## hey programmer

Welcome to Structy! Watch the approach video in the tab at the top of this window to get started.

Write a function _greet_ that takes in a string argument, _s_, and returns the string "hey _s_". No
tricks here. Run the tests to check your work.

#### test_00:
```python
greet("alvin") # -> "hey alvin"
```

#### test_01:
```python
greet("jason") # -> "hey jason"
```

#### test_02:
```python
greet("how now brown cow") # -> 'hey how now brown cow'
```
